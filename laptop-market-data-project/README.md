# Python Data Analysis: Laptop Price Dataset Cleaning

This project demonstrates foundational data wrangling and analytical skills using Python and Pandas. A raw dataset of laptop specifications was systematically cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis, with the full process detailed in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Parsed unstructured strings, converted data types, and handled inconsistencies to create a structured dataset.

- **Feature Engineering:** Created new, valuable features (e.g., `Processor_Manufacturer`, `Graphics_Memory_GB`) from existing raw data.

- **Analytical Problem-Solving:** Used exploratory analysis (ANOVA) to develop a statistically-driven strategy for imputing missing values.

- **Scripting & Automation:** Leveraged Python to programmatically clean and transform the dataset, showcasing skills applicable to automating data-centric business workflows.

## Languages & Libraries Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
